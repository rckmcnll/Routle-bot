# 🚌 Routle Bot — v6.5

A Bluesky bot for [Routle](https://routle.city) transit guessing games. Monitors a custom feed, tracks scores, posts daily leaderboards and threaded period standings, reacts to individual results with Portland-flavored commentary, tracks streaks, aces, DNFs, and milestones, manages a Routlers player list, follows new players, and supports a full suite of player DM commands.

Built for the [Portland TriMet Routle community](https://bsky.app/profile/pdxroutl.bsky.social). Easily adaptable to any Routle city or similar game.

## What's new in v6.5

### Head-to-head challenges
Players can now challenge each other to private 1-week tournaments entirely via DM. The bot handles the full lifecycle: invite code generation, a ready-to-forward invite message, accept notifications to the creator, daily standings DMs to all participants throughout the week, and a final report with champion on conclusion. Scoring uses best-of-5-of-7 days (configurable), with DNF counting as 7. Late joiners are supported — only scores from their join date onward count. Two new DM commands: `CHALLENGE` to start a contest, `MYSTATUS` to check active challenges and current rank.

---

## Features

### Daily leaderboard
Posted every day at a configured time. Shows each player's emoji result grid, rank, and a score distribution histogram. Tied players are broken by all-time average score. Handles Bluesky's 300-character limit — long player lists split across continuation posts automatically.

### Period standings (weekly / monthly / yearly)
Posted on a schedule as correctly threaded reply chains. Uses Unicode Mathematical Monospace formatting with figure-space padding for aligned columns. Long standings split across multiple posts automatically. Uses configurable ranking methods per period.

𝟷𝟶. 𝚋𝚞𝚜𝚘𝚗𝚕𝚢        ⌀𝟷.𝟸𝟶 (𝚋𝟻)  𝟼/𝟽𝚍 ⭐
```

### Reactions
The bot replies to each player's score post with Portland-flavored commentary:
- **First ace ever** — special one-time celebratory message from `FIRST_ACE_MESSAGES`
- **Subsequent aces** — celebratory message with all-time ace count
- **Guesses 2–5** — score-appropriate commentary
- **DNF** — commiseration
- **Streaks** — 🔥 suffix for consecutive days, new personal bests called out

Reactions are suppressed during configurable quiet hours. Opted-out players still appear in leaderboards.

### Milestones
Separate additional reply when a player hits configurable thresholds:
- **Ace milestones** — at 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500 (and every 100 thereafter)
- **Games played milestones** — at 3, 7, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 365
- **DNF milestones** — every 5 DNFs (celebrating persistence)

### Auto-follow
The bot follows each new player from the bot account on their first result, and adds them to the Routlers curated list (opt-outs excluded from list but still followed).

### Fun standings
Ad-hoc novelty categories posted on demand as a threaded reply chain, each with a description post appended. A random category can also be scheduled daily. Available categories:

**Day of week** — `dow_monday` through `dow_sunday` — best avg score per player on that weekday.

**Score counts** — `score_2` through `score_5` — most times a player scored that exact value.

**Streaks** (minimum 3 consecutive days) — `ace_streak`, `no_dnf_streak`, `sub3_streak` (scores 1–2), `struggle_streak` (scores 4–5 or DNF).

**Yahtzee-style** (all require consecutive calendar days, no DNFs):
- `three_kind` — 3 identical scores on 3 consecutive days
- `four_kind` — 4 identical scores on 4 consecutive days (four-of-a-kind windows excluded from three-of-a-kind count)
- `full_house` — 3 of one score + 2 of another across 5 consecutive days
- `small_straight` — four consecutive score values (1–2–3–4 or 2–3–4–5) in any order across 4 consecutive days
- `large_straight` — all five score values (1–2–3–4–5) in any order across 5 consecutive days
- `yahtzee` — 5 identical scores on 5 consecutive days
- `full_card` — players who have achieved at least one of all six Yahtzee categories, ranked by total combined hits

All Yahtzee categories use non-overlapping windows (10 consecutive aces = 2 Yahtzees).

**Comedy** — `dnf_royalty` (most DNFs, celebrated), `eternal_3` (most scores of exactly 3), `clutch_rate` (% of plays that were guess-5), `variance` (most chaotic scoring), `most_improved` (biggest avg drop from first 7 to last 7 games).

Each fun standings post ends with a light, Portland-flavored description of the methodology.

### Community records
After each daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboard, the bot checks for new records across daily/weekly/monthly player counts, per-score daily highs (most aces, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, or DNFs in a day), and most new players in a day. Records are posted as a nested reply under the leaderboard when broken.

### Reliable threaded posting
Multi-page standings use correct Bluesky thread structure (`root` always points to page 1, `parent` to the immediately preceding post). Each post is confirmed as indexed in the AppView before the next reply is posted. Failed posts are retried up to `API_RETRIES` times.

### Feed polling
Polls the feed every N minutes for near-realtime reactions. Leaderboards post on a separate scheduled cadence.

### Head-to-head challenges

Players can challenge each other to private 1-week tournaments via DM. The bot manages the full lifecycle — registration, daily standings, and a final report.

**How it works:**
1. A player DMs `CHALLENGE` to start a new challenge. The bot replies with a 6-character invite code and a pre-formatted invite message ready to copy and send.
2. The creator shares the code. Invited players DM the code to the bot to enroll.
3. The bot notifies the creator each time someone accepts.
4. The challenge activates the next day and a start notice goes to all participants.
5. Daily standings DMs are sent at `CHALLENGE_REPORT_TIME` throughout the week.
6. On the morning after the final day, the bot sends a final report with champion and full results to everyone.

**Scoring:** best `CHALLENGE_BEST_OF` scores (default: 5) of 7 days, lowest total wins. DNF counts as 7. Late joiners are welcome — only scores from their join date onward count.

**Invite flow example:**

Creator DMs `CHALLENGE`, receives a confirmation followed immediately by a ready-to-forward invite:
```
I'm challenging you to a 1-week Routle - TriMet tournament!

It begins tomorrow, Thursday, May 8 and runs until Thursday, May 15, 2026.

To accept, DM AB3X7K to @pdxroutl.bsky.social
```

When an invitee accepts, the creator is notified:
```
@busonly just accepted your challenge AB3X7K! 3 players are now registered. Contest starts 2026-05-08. 🚊
```

Final report sent to all participants on conclusion:
```
🏁 FINAL RESULTS — Challenge AB3X7K
📅 2026-05-08 → 2026-05-15  |  4 players
Scoring: best 5 of 7 days  (DNF = 7)

#### Stats card

Sending `stats` triggers a DM with a full personal breakdown — games, streaks, aces, DNFs, average score (excl. DNFs), all-time rank, and a score distribution histogram.

```
📊 Routle stats — @𝚋𝚞𝚜𝚘𝚗𝚕𝚢

🎮 𝟺𝟽 games  🔥 streak 𝟻d  (best 𝟷𝟸d)
⭐ 𝟾 aces  💀 𝟹 DNFs

𝟹▸ ███████ 𝟷𝟻
𝟺▸ ██ 𝟻
𝟻▸ 𝟶
✗▸ 𝟹
```

#### History card

Sending `hist` or `history` triggers a DM with all scores for the current year, grouped by month:

```
📅 Routle history 2026 — @𝚛𝚘𝚌𝚔𝚘𝚖

── April ──
❌  𝟾  DNF

🟧 𝟷𝟶  3
🟩 𝟷𝟾  1

13 games played  ·  ⌀3.17 (excl. DNFs)  ·  7 DNFs
```

#### Yahtzee card

Sending `yahtzee` triggers a DM with the player's personal Yahtzee scorecard. Each of the six categories shows count and most recent date achieved:

```
🎲 Routle Yahtzee Card — @𝚠𝚒𝚕𝚕𝚘𝚠𝚊𝚜𝚑𝚖𝚊𝚙𝚕𝚎

⚀ Three of a Kind: 𝟺× (last 4/20)
⚁ Four of a Kind: 𝟸× (last 4/20)
⚂ Full House: 𝟷× (last 4/18)
⚃ Small Straight: —
⚄ Large Straight: —
⚅ Yahtzee!: —

3/6 categories unlocked. 3 to go!
```

Players with all six categories unlocked receive a special full scorecard message.

---

## Customizing messages

All reaction and milestone messages live at the bottom of `config.py`. Edit freely — the bot picks randomly from each list. No code changes needed.

| List | Fired when | Placeholders |
|---|---|---|
| `FIRST_ACE_MESSAGES` | Player's very first ace (once, ever) | `{display_name}`, `{handle}` |
| `ACE_MESSAGES` | Every subsequent ace | `{display_name}`, `{handle}`, `{aces_line}` |
| `ACE_COUNT_LINES` | Appended to every ace message | `{aces}` |
| `DNF_MESSAGES` | All guesses wrong | `{display_name}`, `{handle}` |
| `SCORE_MESSAGES[2–5]` | Got it on guess 2–5 | `{display_name}`, `{handle}` |
| `MILESTONE_MESSAGES["ace"]` | Ace milestone hit | `{display_name}`, `{handle}`, `{count}` |
| `MILESTONE_MESSAGES["games"]` | Games played milestone | `{display_name}`, `{handle}`, `{count}` |
| `MILESTONE_MESSAGES["dnf"]` | DNF milestone (every 5) | `{display_name}`, `{handle}`, `{count}` |

Streak suffixes (🔥) are appended automatically — no need to add them to messages.

---

## Data files

All files created automatically on first run. Safe to edit manually.

All data files live in the `data/` subdirectory. Log files live in `logs/`. Both directories are created automatically on `./run_bot.sh install` or `./run_bot.sh start`.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `data/scores.json` | `{"YYYY-MM-DD": {"handle": guess_number}}` |
| `data/aces.json` | `{"handle": total_ace_count}` |
| `data/streaks.json` | `{"handle": {"current": N, "best": N, "last_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}}` |
| `data/optouts.json` | `["handle", ...]` |
| `data/known_players.json` | `{"handle": "did:plc:..."}` |
| `data/dnf_counts.json` | `{"handle": total_dnf_count}` |
| `data/records.json` | `{"daily_players": {"record": N, "date": "..."}, "weekly_players": {...}, "monthly_players": {...}, "new_players_day": {...}, "new_players": {"YYYY-MM-DD": N}, "daily_score_1": {...}, ...}` |
| `data/fun_history.json` | `{"category_key": "YYYY-MM-DD", ...}` — last posted date per fun category, enforces the 14-day no-repeat window |
| `data/challenges.json` | All challenge state — code, creator, status, start/end dates, participants, last report date. Created automatically on first `CHALLENGE` DM. |
| `data/reactions.json` | Set of post URIs the bot has already reacted to. Prevents duplicate reactions across restarts or concurrent runs. |
| `logs/bot.log` | Rotating log file (5 MB cap, up to `LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` backups) |

All saves are **atomic** — written to a `.tmp` file then renamed, so a crash mid-write never corrupts live data.

## Reliability notes

- **Retry logic** — each post is attempted up to `API_RETRIES` times before giving up, with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s …). All API calls — feed fetches, logins, DM sends — share the same retry wrapper, so transient timeouts and connection resets recover automatically rather than killing the poll cycle
- **Configurable timeout** — `API_TIMEOUT` (default 20s) applies to every Bluesky API call
- **Read-confirm** — after posting, the bot polls `app.bsky.feed.getPosts` until the post is confirmed visible in the AppView before continuing
- **Correct threading** — multi-page standings use `root` (always page 1) and `parent` (immediately preceding post) as required by the AT Protocol
- **Atomic writes** — all JSON data files use write-then-rename to prevent corruption
- **Rotating log file** — `bot.log` is capped at 5 MB with up to `LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` backups, managed automatically via `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`
- **Quiet hours** — reactions suppressed between `QUIET_HOURS_START` and `QUIET_HOURS_END`; scores are still recorded

---

## Adapting to another city

```python
FEED_CREATOR_HANDLE = "feedowner.bsky.social"
FEED_SLUG           = "routle-chicago"
GAME_NAME           = "Routle"
GAME_DOMAIN         = "routle.city"
```

Then update the message lists in `config.py` with your city's local references.
